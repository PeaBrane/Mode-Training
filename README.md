# RBM-Training

This repo is no longer being maintained, because MATLAB is terrible for machine learning, and the author didn't know any better back then.
In fact, the entire codebase can be condensed into a single ipynb file and made 3 orders of magnitude more efficient. 
For instance, see https://github.com/PeaBrane/rbm_jax for a proof-of-concept implementation in Jax.
